            </span>
            <p class="movie-description">
                Arguably one of the greatest superhero films of all time, The Dark Knight redefined the genre by blending gritty realism with compelling drama. This second installment in Nolan's Batman trilogy follows Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) as he confronts his most formidable foe, the Joker (Heath Ledger). Ledger’s Oscar-winning performance brought a chilling, anarchic energy to the role, elevating the film into a cinematic masterpiece. Nolan masterfully explores themes of chaos, morality, and sacrifice while delivering thrilling action sequences, including the iconic bank heist and the jaw-dropping chase through Gotham. The film’s tight screenplay and Hans Zimmer’s haunting score further solidify its legacy.
